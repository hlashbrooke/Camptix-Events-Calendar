Making CampTix and The Events Calendar work in harmony for the benefit of your meetup group.

== Description ==

"CampTix & Events Calendar for Meetup Groups" is an add-on for [CampTix](https://wordpress.org/plugins/camptix/) and [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/) that lets you use these two great plugins to manage events for your meetup group.

"CampTix & Events Calendar for Meetup Groups" adds the following features:

* New 'Sponsor' taxonomy for events so you can specify any number of sponsors per event and display them on event pages
* Link up CampTix tickets and events allowing you to display event attendees on your event pages

You can see an example of this plugin in action on a single event page from my local WordPress meetup group in Cape Town [here](http://www.wpcapetown.co.za/event/july-2014-meetup/) and [here](http://www.wpcapetown.co.za/event/april-2014-meetup/).
